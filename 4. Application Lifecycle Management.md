# Application Lifecycle Management

## Rolling updates and rollbacks

Create a deployment trigger a rollout, as well as updation an application (when the container version changes). A rollout create a new deployment revision.

- ```kubectl rollout status deployment/<name>``` to see how many replicas are available already
- ```kubectl rollout history deployment/name``` show revisions & change-cause

Deployment Strategy:
- Rolling update (default), 1 replica is created, 1 old is killed, until all old pods are killed
- Recreate

 When a new deployment happens, a new ReplicaSet is created, and all the new pods are created there until the old ReplicaSet is empty

 ```kubectl rollout undo deployment/<name>``` rollback a deployment, with the same strategy

 ## Commands & Arguments

 A docker image can have an ENTRYPOINT attribute, and has a CMD attribute. the ENTRYPOINT will prefix the command, space separated. To override these when running a docker image, we would use ```docker run [--entrypoint <value>] <imageName> <CMDvalue>```.

 In a pod, this happens in the spec.container attribut, with the ```command``` attribute overriding entrypoint, and ```args``` overriding CMD.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: command-demo
  labels:
    purpose: demonstrate-command
spec:
  containers:
  - name: command-demo-container
    image: debian
    command: ["printenv"]
    args: ["HOSTNAME", "KUBERNETES_PORT"]
  restartPolicy: OnFailure
```

 ## Env var

In the spec.container section of a pod, the attribute ```env``` allow list of ```name``` & ```value``` attributes to store env variables.
 
ConfigMap & Secrets can do the same, but in this case we'll use ```valueFrom``` instead of ```value```, with child object ```configMapKeyRef``` or ```secretKeyRef``` , which has an attribute ```name```, the name of the ConfigSecret/Secret, and ```key```, the key we want to add to the pod.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: dapi-test-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: test-container
      image: registry.k8s.io/busybox
      command: [ "/bin/sh", "-c", "env" ]
      env:
        - name: SPECIAL_LEVEL_KEY
          valueFrom:
            configMapKeyRef:
              name: special-config
              key: special.how
        - name: LOG_LEVEL
          valueFrom:
            configMapKeyRef:
              name: env-config
              key: log_level
  restartPolicy: Never
```

Another option is to mount a volume and add its configMap.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: dapi-test-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: test-container
      image: registry.k8s.io/busybox
      command: [ "/bin/sh", "-c", "ls /etc/config/" ]
      volumeMounts:
      - name: config-volume
        mountPath: /etc/config
  volumes:
    - name: config-volume
      configMap:
        # Provide the name of the ConfigMap containing the files you want
        # to add to the container
        name: special-config
  restartPolicy: Never
```

Instead of env, we can use ```envFrom```, that will take  list of ```configMapRef``` or ```secretRef```, both having an child attribute name, the name of the configMap/Secret. In this case, all key/value pair will be sent to the the pod.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: dapi-test-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: test-container
      image: registry.k8s.io/busybox
      command: [ "/bin/sh", "-c", "env" ]
      envFrom:
      - configMapRef:
          name: special-config
  restartPolicy: Never
```

- ```kubectl create configmap <name> --from-literal=K=V [--from-literal=K2=V2]``` to create directly the ConfigMap env variables
- ```kubectl create configamp <name> -from-file=<path>``` to use a property file instead
- ```kubectl create secret generic <name> --from-literal=K=V [--from-literal=K2=V2]``` to create directly the ConfigMap env variables
- ```kubectl create secret generic <name> -from-file=<path>``` to use a property file instead

Secrets are encoded to base64, not encrypted, even in ETCD by default. This article explains how to do it [Enabling Encryption at Rest](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/encrypt-data/). Also, anyone with the rights to create pods or deployments in the namespace can view secrets, so we need to configure Role Base Access to give least-privilege access to secrets. It's generally better to use third-party secret store providers.

Secrets are only send to node if a pod requires it, and are stores into a tmpfs so it's not written on disk. It's deleted as soon as the dependant pod dies.

[Here is a video to manage cluster secrets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTnQW9MxnRI) (out of CKA scope)

## Multi containers pods

Pods can run several containers at the same time if needed, and there are 3 pattern for that: Sidecar, adapter, and ambassador. Once again, this is out of scope (CKAD exam)

Containers in a pod have to all be alive, otherwise the pod is restarted. For operation that must be done just one as startup, use ```initContainers``` instead. initContainers are run one by one sequentially, and have to complete for the next one to start. When all done, containers can then start.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: myapp-pod
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: MyApp
spec:
  containers:
  - name: myapp-container
    image: busybox:1.28
    command: ['sh', '-c', 'echo The app is running! && sleep 3600']
  initContainers:
  - name: init-myservice
    image: busybox:1.28
    command: ['sh', '-c', "until nslookup myservice.$(cat /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/namespace).svc.cluster.local; do echo waiting for myservice; sleep 2; done"]
  - name: init-mydb
    image: busybox:1.28
    command: ['sh', '-c', "until nslookup mydb.$(cat /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/namespace).svc.cluster.local; do echo waiting for mydb; sleep 2; done"]
```

Finally, there is a concept of self-healing apps in kubernetes, so they restart in case of crash. This is accomplished with Deployments and ReplicaSet, but also with liveness & readiness probes, which, once again, is out of scope (CKAD)
