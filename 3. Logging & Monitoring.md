# Logging & Monitoring

Metrics server is an in-memory solution that expose resources from kubelet's cAdisor (containor advisor), which retrieve performance metrics, and expose them through the kubelet API. To view historical performance data, you have to use an advanced solution, such as Prometheus, Elastic Stack, Datadog, Dynatrace...

If using Minikube, ```minikube addons enable metrics-server```. Otherwise ```git clone https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server.git```, then ```kubectl create -f <folder>```

> Minikube is a tool to setup a simple single-node on a local machine

```kubectl top node``` and ```kubectl top pods``` can then be used to check cpu & memory consumption.

To view the log of an application, simply use ```kubectl logs -f <podName> <containerName>```. If there is only one container on a pod, the container name is not necessary.

> -f means that we are streaming the logs as they come

That's all we need to know about logs regarding the CKA certification.
